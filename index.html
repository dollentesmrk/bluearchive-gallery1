          <p style="text-align: justify;">
            The Supplementary Lesson Department is a club that was hastily formed by Trinity's student council, the Tea Party, to provide assistance to students with failing exam grades! Although this task would normally be handled by the Tea Party, the close proximity of the Eden Treaty means that they have little time to spare.
