          <p style="text-align: justify;">
            The Supplementary Lesson Department is a club that was hastily formed by Trinity's student council, the Tea Party, to provide assistance to students with failing exam grades! Although this task would normally be handled by the Tea Party, the close proximity of the Eden Treaty means that they have little time to spare.

          The ice witch of Trinity's Supplemental Lessons Club. For various reasons, she had dropped out of school and re-enrolled at Trinity. One to mainly keep to herself, she tends to voluntarily distance herself from others so as to not be a bother. This has led to others in the Supplemental Lessons club worrying for her.

          <p style = "text-align: justify;"> Shimoe Koharu originally belonged to the Justice Realization Committee, but her grades fell and she fell into a crisis of repeating a year and was forced to transfer to the remedial class department. She thinks she is an elite, but in reality, she is too stupid to keep up with her schoolwork. She has a hobby of collecting lewd magazines, and is often embarrassed to be alone with her fantasies about even the most trivial things.</p>
